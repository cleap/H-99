# H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

These are my solutions to [Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems),
which are translations of [Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html),
which are themselves translations of [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20170324220754/https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).

## Why should I take your word for it?

To test my solutions, run

```bash
